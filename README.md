Matlab code for an animated 6*6 density matrix of a PPT

Files Included
animatedDensityMatrix.m - ANIMATEDDENSITYMATRIX animate a density matrix in a system of two 
calcite crystals with a half wave plate of variable theta between 
them and another half wave plate of minus theta after the second crystal.

checkProximityToMatrix.m - CHECKPROXIMITYTOMATRIX show the proximity of density matrices to the
target matrix. The system consists of 2 sequential configurations of a
calcite crystal, polarizer, HWP, where each of the HWP and polarizers can
have a varying angle.
